# ðŸ“„ Config
You need to place `config.json` in the same directory as the jar.\
This is an example config, you can use it if you want:
```
{
  "appId": "995501904685715476",
  "smallImage": "https://aetherclient.com/images/gato.png",
  "largeImage": "https://c.tenor.com/hEwfEcj2R60AAAAd/laptop-smoking.gif",
  "showPCActiveTime": false
}
```

# ðŸŸ¢ Usage
Either build it yourself or go to [releases](https://github.com/imAETHER/PCStats/releases) and download it.

# ðŸ’» Supported platforms
All platforms since its java & its using OSHI (haven't tested tho), for now GPU usage and temperature only works with NVIDIA gpus that have nvidia-smi.
