# âœ¨ Usage
Either build it yourself or go to [releases](https://github.com/imAETHER/PCStats/releases) and download it.

This project uses OSHI to get processor temperatures, OSHI uses [OpenHardwareMonitor](https://openhardwaremonitor.org/) to get these, download and run it in the background while you use the RPC to get accurate readings.<br>

- Make a folder and place the jar in there
- Open the jar (with java 8 or above)
- It will automatically create `config.json` in the current directory and will open the GUI!
- You can now edit the RPC as you wish
  - Once the RPC is running you can click the close button to minimize it to tray, click the tray icon to bring PCStats back up.
  - To close it click "Stop RPC" and then you can close it normally.
- Configs are automatically saved on exit

### You can customize both text fields and images!<br>

All platforms since its java & its using OSHI (haven't tested tho), for now GPU usage and temperature **only works with NVIDIA gpus that have nvidia-smi**.
